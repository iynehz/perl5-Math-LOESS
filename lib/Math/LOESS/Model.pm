=head1 NAME

Math::LOESS::Model - Math::LOESS model configurations

=head1 VERSION

version 0.0000_02

=head1 DESCRIPTION

You normally don't need to construct object of this class yourself.
Instead you get the object from an L<Math::LOESS> object.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 span

The parameter controls the degree of smoothing. Default is 0.75.

For C<span> < 1, the neighbourhood used for the fit includes proportion
C<span> of the points, and these have tricubic weighting (proportional to
C<(1 - (dist/maxdist)^3)^3)>. For C<span> > 1, all points are used, with
the "maximum distance" assumed to be C<span^(1/p)> times the actual
maximum distance for p explanatory variables.

=head2 degree

The degree of the polynomials to be used, normally 1 or 2. Default is 2.

=head2 parametric

Should any terms be fitted globally rather than locally? Default is false.
Terms can be specified by name, number or as a logical vector of the same
length as the number of predictors.

=head2 drop_square

For fits with more than one predictor and degree = 2, should the quadratic
term be dropped for particular predictors? Default is false.
Terms are specified in the same way as for parametric.

=head2 normalize

Should the predictors be normalized to a common scale if there is more
than one? The normalization used is to set the 10% trimmed standard
deviation to one. Set to false for spatial coordinate predictors and
others known to be on a common scale.

=head2 family

If C<"gaussian"> fitting is by least-squares, and if C<"symmetric"> a
re-descending M estimator is used with Tukey's biweight function.
